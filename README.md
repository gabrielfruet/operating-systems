# Tanenbau Modern Operating Systems review.

A simple review of Tanenbau Modern Operating Systems book.

Structured like the chapters and sections of the book.

Mostly made for using with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but you can use any other MD visualization tool.

Start at [summary](./Summary.md).

Have fun!
